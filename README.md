# PR Workflow Demo

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the creation of pull requests (PRs) when changes are pushed to a specific branch. The workflow streamlines the process of merging updates—such as automated image or dependency updates—by automatically opening a PR for review and merging.

This was just a test to see if I could get this to work.
And it did work
